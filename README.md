# Personal DotFiles

These dot files cover linux, mac, and windows. They are generally organized by use case to make it easier to mix and match configurations as needed. If configuration is specific to an operating system, the folder name will be marked with an os specific prefix. If there are multiple different options for a given class of software, those configurations will be separated by subfolder where needed.

Currently, its recommended to clone this repository and create sim links to where the configuration is expected to be.
In the future I might add some bootstrapping tooling to make this process smoother.
